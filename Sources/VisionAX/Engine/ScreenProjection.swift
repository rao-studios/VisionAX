//  ScreenProjection.swift
//  VisionAX
//
//  WHAT: The map between a detection's image pixels and the screen it was cut from.
//  IN:   the capturer — it alone knows the window origin and the measured density
//  OUT:  VisionScene.screenRect / screenPoint; every consumer that clicks
//  PIN:  THE SCALE IS MEASURED, NEVER ASSUMED. A detection carries no scale of its
//        own (the image does not know it), so a caller that guesses 2x is wrong on a
//        1x display and wrong again on any future density. This type is the one place
//        the two coordinate systems meet, and it is pure arithmetic so a test can pin it.
