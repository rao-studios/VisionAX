//  WHAT: The API door — one call, one image conversion, every lane the caller asked for.
//  IN:   a CGImage plus the projection that says where on screen it came from
//  OUT:  VisionScene
//  PIN:  A REGION IS A CROP, AND THE CROP MOVES THE PROJECTION — not the tree. Frames
//        stay in the coordinates of the pixels that were actually examined, and
//        `scene.projection` carries the offset, so a caller that asks for screen
//        coordinates gets the right answer without anything having rewritten a rect.
//        This is also what makes a region cheap: the detector never sees the pixels
//        outside it, so a page's worth of chrome costs nothing to skip.
//        ONE BGRA CONVERSION PER CALL. Every lane reads the same buffer.
