//
//  WHAT: Where one perception's time went, phase by phase.
//  IN:   VisionEngine.perceive  OUT: VisionScene.timing
//  PIN:  MEASURED FROM INSIDE, BECAUSE FROM OUTSIDE IT IS NOT THE SAME CALL. Timing the
//        lanes by invoking them separately double-counts the image conversion, misses
//        the union entirely, and cannot see that the classifier is handed a buffer the
//        detector already built — the parts add up to more than the whole, which is a
//        way of being wrong about which part to improve.
//        THE PHASES SUM TO THE TOTAL, and `other` carries the remainder rather than
//        letting it vanish. A breakdown that does not add up is a breakdown nobody can
//        act on.
//        ALWAYS ON. Two clock reads per phase against tens of milliseconds of work is
//        not a cost worth a flag, and a measurement you have to remember to switch on is
//        one you do not have when it matters.
