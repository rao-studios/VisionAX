//  IN:   VisionEngine.perceive
//  OUT:  Mary's page lane; the bench
//  PIN:  THE SCENE ANSWERS IN POINTS, THE DETECTION SPEAKS IN PIXELS. Every query here
//        takes and returns SCREEN coordinates, because a caller that wants to click
//        something should never have to know a scale existed. The pixel frames stay
//        reachable underneath for anyone drawing over the image itself.
//        A HIT TEST PICKS THE SMALLEST CONTAINING BOX. Regions nest, and the largest
//        box containing a point is almost always the page; the smallest is the thing.
