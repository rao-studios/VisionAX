//
//  PageMap.swift
//  VisionAX
//
//  WHAT: A page as things one can act on — named, grouped, and in reading order.
//  IN:   VisionScene.pageMap()
//  OUT:  Mary's page lane; the bench overlay
//  PIN:  READING ORDER IS THE INVARIANT, AND IT IS THE ONLY ORDINAL. Groups run top to
//        bottom, members run band by band and then leading to trailing. A consumer that
//        says "the first result" counts this array; there is no second ordinal stored
//        anywhere that could disagree with it.
//        NOTHING IS DROPPED FOR WANT OF A NAME. The roster's old rule — no label, no
//        row — is exactly what made a page of results look empty. Every box that can be
//        acted on survives, carrying WHERE its name came from, so a caller can tell a
//        classifier's word from a guess.
//        PIXELS, LIKE EVERY OTHER DETECTION. The scene projects to screen points; this
//        does not, so nothing here has to know a scale existed.
//
