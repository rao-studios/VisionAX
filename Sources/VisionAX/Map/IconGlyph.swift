//  VisionAX
//
//  WHAT: A wordless control, named by what it is drawn as.
//  IN:   VisionEngine.matchIcons
//  OUT:  the page map's label ladder
//  PIN:  A RUNG, NOT AN ORACLE. Every icon scores something against every other, so the
//        floor below is the whole difference between a name and a guess — and an icon
//        that scores under it keeps its position and is still pressable. Nothing here
//        may decide whether a control exists.
//        THE WORD IS WHAT A PERSON WOULD SAY. "search", not "magnifier"; "more", not
//        "kebab". The name is for resolving a phrase against, so it is spoken English
//        rather than an icon designer's vocabulary.
