//  WHAT: Boxes gathered into the units a person means — rows, cards, lists, forms,
//        toolbars, overlays.
//  IN:   candidate frames + text lines
//  OUT:  PageMapGroup, and the reading order everything else counts
//  PIN:  GEOMETRY, NEVER MARKUP AND NEVER A SITE. A results page is a run of bands of
//        similar height at a regular pitch; so is a mail list and a table of orders.
//        That is the whole rule, and it is why nothing here has to be taught a site.
//        A LIST IS WHAT MAKES "THE FIRST ONE" MEAN ANYTHING. Without a repeated run
//        there is no ordinal to count, so this pass is not decoration — it is the
//        difference between a page of boxes and a page of results.
//        PURE. Rectangles in, groups out.
