//
//  WHAT: A scene, assembled into the page map a consumer acts on.
//  IN:   VisionScene (regions + text)
//  OUT:  PageMap
//  PIN:  THIS DOES NOT GO THROUGH `roster`. The roster drops any node the classifier
//        did not name and any node without a label, which on a real results page is
//        almost all of them — measured: 33% proposal recall, no rows at all, and a page
//        of results that read as four chrome buttons. The map keeps what the roster
//        threw away and says how sure it is instead.
//        A TEXT LINE IS A THING TO PRESS WHEN IT LEADS A REPEATED BAND. A result title
//        is an anchor around a heading with no border to find an edge on; the band it
//        sits in, repeated down the page, is the evidence that it is a result. Marked
//        `.grouping`, so nothing pretends the classifier said it.
//        NO SITE, NO ENGINE, NO PRODUCT — geometry and words only.
