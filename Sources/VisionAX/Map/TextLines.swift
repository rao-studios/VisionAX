//  WHAT: Recognized words gathered into lines and blocks, and offered as proposals.
//  IN:   [TextRun] from the text lane
//  OUT:  the page map; the harvester's ground-truth matching
//  PIN:  THE SAME FUNCTION AT HARVEST AND AT INFERENCE. A text line that becomes a
//        proposal only when the model runs is a box the model was never trained on, and
//        it answers `none` for exactly the rows that matter — a result title is an
//        anchor around a heading, and the detector's edge pass does not see it because
//        there is no edge to see. Both paths call `proposals(from:)`, so what the head
//        learns is what the head is asked.
//        PURE. No engine, no image, no state — geometry over rectangles, testable on
//        made-up numbers.
