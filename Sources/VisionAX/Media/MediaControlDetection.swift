//
//  MediaControlDetection.swift
//  VisionAX
//
//  WHAT: One look at a player's transport — where the controls are and what the
//        evidence says about whether it is playing.
//  IN:   VisionEngine.readMediaControls
//  OUT:  Mary's browsing lane; the bench's media overlay
//  PIN:  WITNESSES, NOT A VERDICT DRESSED AS ONE. `playback` is derived from three
//        independent observations — the picture moved, the progress fraction advanced,
//        the clock advanced — and `witnesses` names the ones that actually spoke. When
//        they disagree, a caller can see that they did instead of being handed the
//        majority answer with the disagreement thrown away.
//        SLOTS ARE POSITIONAL. The leftmost control in the bar is play/pause and the
//        rightmost is fullscreen in every player anyone has shipped; that layout, not
//        the artwork, is what makes this work on a player it has never seen.
