//        task the system already does well, on the ANE, with no download — spending a
//        second ONNX graph on it would be slower and worse.
//        `.fast` BY DEFAULT: the strings this reads are clocks and button labels a few
//        characters long, and the accurate path costs several times as much to resolve
//        ambiguities that a timestamp does not have.
//        Vision reports NORMALIZED, BOTTOM-LEFT rects; every frame here is flipped into
//        the top-left pixel space the rest of the package speaks, once, at this seam.
